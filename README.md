# class-execution-
Class function that measures execution time.

The first half of the program illustrates the execution time by using the push_back function from the vector library. The second half ot the program illustrates the execution time for the program to run by assigning random values. 
I divided my program into 4 different files: A Header File, Implementation File, Driver File and Make File.
